Revision Control allows finer control over the Post Revision system included with WordPress 2.6

== Description ==

Revision Control is a plugin for WordPress 2.6+ which gives the user more control over the Post/Page Revisions.

The plugin allows the user to set a blog-global setting (Settings -> Revisions) for pages/posts to enable/disable/limit the number of revisions which are saved for the page/post. The user may change this setting on a per-page/post basis from the Revisions Meta box.

The plugin also allows the deletion of specific revisions via the Revisions post metabox.
